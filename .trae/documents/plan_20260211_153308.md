Yes, that is correct. The error `RefererNotAllowedMapError` on localhost confirms that the API key being used has **Referrer Restrictions** enabled in the Google Cloud Console, and `localhost` is not in the allowed list.

Here is the plan to resolve this:

1. **Identify the Key**: The application uses the `PLACE_API_KEY` (or `PLACE_API_KEY_WEB_APP`) defined in your `.env` file. This is loaded in `resources/views/frontends/master.blade.php`.

2. **Solution 1: Update Google Cloud Console (Recommended)**

   * Go to the [Google Cloud Console > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials).

   * Select the API Key matching the one in your `.env`.

   * Under "Application restrictions" -> "Websites", add the following to the list of allowed referrers:

     * `http://localhost:8000/*`

     * `http://127.0.0.1:8000/*`

   * Save the changes. It may take up to 5 minutes to take effect.

3. **Solution 2: Use a Separate Development Key**

   * If you cannot modify the production key restrictions, create a new unrestricted API key (or one restricted to localhost) for development.

   * Update your local `.env` file
