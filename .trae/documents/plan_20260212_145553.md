I will implement the requested features for the Listings Dashboard as follows:

### 1. Hide "Gói dịch vụ : Cao cấp"
- **Action**: Comment out the "Tariff Plan" section in `resources/views/components/dashboard/header.blade.php`.

### 2. Backend Implementation (Controller & Routes)
- **File**: `routes/web.php`
    - Add `DELETE /webapp/listings/{id}` for deleting listings.
    - Add `PATCH /webapp/listings/{id}/toggle` for hiding/showing listings.
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/TelegramWebAppController.php`
    - **Update `listings` method**: 
        - Handle AJAX requests to return partial views or JSON.
        - Implement sorting by **Price** (Low/High) and **Area** (Low/High). *Note: Area sorting will require joining the `assign_parameters` table as area is stored as a parameter.*
        - Enhance search to filter by address/title.
    - **Add `destroy` method**: Handle property deletion with ownership verification.
    - **Add `toggleStatus` method**: Handle status toggling (hide/show).

### 3. Frontend Implementation (View & JS)
- **File**: `resources/views/frontends/components/dashboard_listings.blade.php`
    - **Search**: Add a real-time search input with debouncing.
    - **Sort**: Add a dropdown with options: Newest, Oldest, Price (Low/High, High/Low), Area (Low/High, High/Low).
    - **List Items**:
        - Add a **Toggle Switch** for hiding/showing the listing.
        - Add a **Delete Button** with a confirmation modal (using SweetAlert2 or native confirm).
    - **JavaScript**:
        - Implement `fetchListings` to reload the list via AJAX when search/sort/page changes.
        - Implement `toggleStatus` and `deleteProperty` functions to call the new API endpoints.
        - Add loading state (spinner) during AJAX requests.

### 4. Verification
- Verify elements are hidden/shown correctly.
- Test "Delete" flow with confirmation.
- Test "Toggle" flow and persistence.
- Test "Search" and "Sort" functionality, especially the custom Area sort.
